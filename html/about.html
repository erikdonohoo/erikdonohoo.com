	<h3>What is an erikdonohoo.com account?</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		With your erikdonohoo.com account you can play any of the games here that I have made.  You can compete against others, view scoreboards, and try to work your way up the ranks.  It's totally free and you only need to create a username and password.  If you would like a custom avatar, <strong>make sure you check 'use gravatar' when you register.</strong>  You can always go back and update it later.  If you do choose to use <a href="http://gravatar.com" target="_blank">gravatar</a>, you will need to add an email address.  It is only used to pull your gravatar avatar down from the cloud.
