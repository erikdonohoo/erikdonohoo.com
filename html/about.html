				I love the web.  I am always learning and trying the latest JavaScript and CSS techniques.  I have only been programming for just over 3 years but I have taken to it like a fish to water, especially web technologies.  Whether it be <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> or just about anything else, I've probably used it.  This site is built using Angular.js and I have been a big fan of it lately.  For user authentication and all of my backend support for this site I use a service called <a href="http://parse.com" target="_blank">Parse</a>.  It really makes getting a backend up and running easy.  That doesn't mean I don't know how to work on my own data though.  I have experience with Java and SpringMVC and know how to make RESTful services with those tools.

				I currently live in Orem Utah with my wife Liz of almost 4 years.  We love spending time together and playing with technology.  We love apple products and all things Nintendo.  We are big fans of our Wii U.  I love golfing and enjoy going on the occasional jog.  I am currently employed at the MTC of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as a team-lead over 3 projects currently in development there.  I am also currently the WebMaster for the BYU chapter of <a href="http://acm.byu.edu" target="_blank">ACM</a>.  I have recently overseen the rewrite of the website there.

	<h2>What is an erikdonohoo.com account?</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>
		With your erikdonohoo.com account you can track your scores on any of the games here that I have made.  You don't need an account to play, but isn't it more fun to see how bad you are destroying the competition?  With an account, you can compete against others, view scoreboards, and try to work your way up the ranks.  It's totally free and you only need to choose a username and password and link with an email account.  The email is used <strong><i>ONLY</i></strong> for account resets and for linking to gravatar.  If you would like a custom avatar, <strong>make sure you check 'use gravatar' when you register.</strong>  You can always go back and update it later.  If you do choose to use <a href="http://gravatar.com" target="_blank">gravatar</a>, make sure you use the same email here that you use for the gravatar service.
