	I know why you're <strong><i>really</i></strong> here.  You want to check out some of the games I've made and get the new high score.  Well, feel free to check out any of the games I currently have listed here.  <span ng-show="!loggedIn">If you want your score to be recorded, you're going to have to make an erikdonohoo.com <a href="#/register">account</a>.</span>  You can check out the classic from your Nokia brick phone days, <a href="">Snake</a>.  Or if you are more adventurous why not try out my version of <a href="#">Space Invaderz</a>?  Not for you?  Well take on the machine and play some <a href="">Chess</a>, or just reminisce with some old school <a href="">Mario</a>.
