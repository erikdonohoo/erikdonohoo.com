		Remember this?  Everyone loves snake!  Chase your tail around trying to eat as much food as you can.  I've tried to make this have an 80's arcade feel to it.  As of now, snake is fully functional but I will occasionally add features and alter gameplay.  I'm planning on introducing powerups that your snake can feed on to add some crazy new scenarios.  Good luck and have fun!

		Who doesn't love Mario!  Try my version of the original.  Mario runs all by himself but you need to time your jumps and ducks carefully.  Run and jump on #2 pencils to get those hard to reach coins and baddies.  Your score is based on how many coins you collect and enemies you kill.  Stay alive as long as you can and see if you can make it into the top scores!
